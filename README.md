Activity: Student Information System with File Handling

This program helps to keep student information like their ID, name, age, and grades. It uses tuples and dictionaries to store the data. You can add, change, delete, and see the students. The program saves the data to a file and can load it again later. It also uses simple Python functions to work with the grades and finds the average grade using a small function. Thereâ€™s a menu to choose what to do.
